This repository is an ongoing learning project focused on first-principles understanding rather than completeness.

## What it is

This repo follows a slow, implementation-first approach to AI.

The goal is to re-derive the core mechanisms behind modern models—gradients, backpropagation, attention, and a Transformer block—using explicit math and Rust code.

No frameworks. No hidden abstractions.  
If it can’t be tested or derived, it doesn’t count.

Work is done in low-frequency, high-focus sessions (~1 deep session per week).

## What it is not

- Not a production system
- Not a framework
- Not my main project
- Not focused on performance, scale, or GPUs

This is about understanding execution, memory, and invariants, not chasing tools or trends.

## Structure (evolving)

```text
docs/        — notes, papers, derivations
builds/      — Rust implementations
tests/       — correctness and gradient checks
```

## Contribution

This repo is public for learning and reference.
Issues or clarifications are welcome, but scope is intentionally limited.

## Status

This repository is an ongoing learning project to deepen my understanding in AI.
