# Artificial Intelligence

A small repository where I study modern AI by rebuilding its primitives from first principles in Rust.

## What it is

This repo follows a slow, implementation-first approach to AI.

The goal is to re-derive the core mechanisms behind modern models, gradients, backpropagation, attention, and a Transformer block. Using explicit math and Rust code.

No frameworks. No hidden abstractions.  
If it can’t be tested or derived, it doesn’t count.

Work is done in low-frequency, high-focus sessions (~1 deep session per week).

## What it is not

- Not a production system
- Not a framework
- Not my main project
- Not focused on performance, scale, or GPUs

This is about understanding execution, memory, and invariants, not chasing tools or trends.
